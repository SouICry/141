The assember or compile for our assemble code is written in java. To compile
a assmbly file, all you need to do is simply compile Assembler.java and
type "java Assembler source destination" in the terminal, where source is the 
assembly code and destination is the if the machine code. We have included the
assembly code for all three problems. They are named problem1, problem2, and
problem3. We also provided the machine code files that are generated by our 
compile. They are named testout1, testout2, and testout3. The number corresponds
to the problems. In addition, both of the source assembly code and machine code
are well commented. The source code for the assembler is also commented.
